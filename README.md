# FinalProject

A simple Hangman project in Rust with user input.
This proect includes a text file with a list of words that will be randomly selected by the program for the user to guess.
When running the program, the user is welcomed into the game and a set of blank letter spaces is displayed for the word the user is trying to guess.
The user is given five turns to start, and loses a turn with each wrong letter guessed.
If the user guesses the word before running out of turns, the program will congratulate them on winning the game.
If the user runs out of turns before guessing the word, the game stops and the program  will tell the user that they lost the game.
